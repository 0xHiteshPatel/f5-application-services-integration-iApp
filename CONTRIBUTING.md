# Contributing Guide for f5-application-services-integration-iApp
If you have found this that means you you want to help us out. Thanks in advance for lending a hand! This guide should get you up and running quickly and make it easy for you to contribute.  If we don't answer your questions here and you need help or just want to say hi, shoot us an email at TBD(email).

## Issues
Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better. Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even more.
 
### Bugs
TODO: What do we want in our bug reports and an example?

### Feature Requests and Enhancements
TODO: What do we want in our feature requests and an example?

## Pull Requests
If you are submitting a pull request, you need to make sure that you have done a few things first.

* If an issue doesn't exist, file one.
* Make sure you have tested your code because we are going to do that when when you make your PR.  You don't want _The Hat_ because your request fails unit tests.
*  Clean up your git history because no one wants to see 75 commits for one issue
*  Use our [commit template](.git-commit-template.txt)
*  Use our pull request template
