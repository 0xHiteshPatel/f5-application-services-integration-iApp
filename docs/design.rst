Design Methodology & Goals
==========================

Goals
-----

The high level goals for this project are as follows:

 - Enable utilization of the full F5 L4-7 feature set while masking complexity
   from NorthBound systems
 - Cover the most common deployment use cases as standard, community supported,
   features
 - Provide simple extension mechanisms for customization that may be required
   in your environment
 - Minimize (over time) changes to the NorthBound API Data Model
 - Normalize F5 specific configuration as much as possible between all 
   integrations
 - Rapidly deliver new features and functionality
 - Support a broad range of F5 BIG-IP software releases

iApp Basics & Constraints
-------------------------

.. NOTE::
	For full documentation on iApp's please refer to the 
	`F5 DevCentral iApp Wiki`_  This documentation is limited to explaining how
	we utilize the iApp infrastructure with this particular project.

Basic Terms
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
	:header: "Term","Definition"
	:widths: 20 80
	:stub-columns: 1

	"iApp template","A file (.tmpl extension) that contains the tmsh_ importable
	definition of an iApp.  The template contains the implementation and 
	presentation layers along with other settings"
	"Presentation layer","The APL_ definition of the user interface and API data
	model for the iApp template"
	"Implementation layer","The TCL based tmsh_ script that actually processes 
	input defined in the presentation layer and deploys a configuration on the 
	BIG-IP device"
	"[North/South]bound","The direction of API calls in an implementation.  
	Northbound generally implies integration with another system or product 
	through a standardized API (REST, SOAP, etc).  Southbound generally implies
	vendor specific integration through open or non-standards based APIs"
	"BIG-IP","The data plane element that executes the implementation layer code
	of an iApp template and deploys a config to process network traffic"
	"iWorkflow","The *optional* control plane element that interacts with and 
	manipulates the presentation layer of an iApp"

Presentation Layer Contraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To provide the broadest compatibility with third-party systems we implement a 
very simple presentation layer.  Advanced TCL-based programmatic logic in the 
presentation layer is not implemented by this iApp (even though APL supports 
this).  The reasoning behind this is that there is no reliable, standard way to 
execute logical arguments in third party systems.  Some simple use cases are 
implemented (e.g. auto-population of a dropdown), however, these are only useful
when the iApp Presentation Layer is rendered via the BIG-IP GUI.  As a result 
all functionality implemented is required to function correctly without this 
programmatic logic.

Implementation Layer Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within the implementation layer we have a lot more flexibility in how features 
are implemented.  Generally, anything is possible, however we take care to 
implement features in a manner that can work with all possible integrations.  

All deployments are fully Partition_ and `Route-Domain`_ aware to enable full 
multi-tenancy.  When running in Standalone mode users may choose to simply use 
the Common partition and route-domain 0 to achieve a non-multi-tenant 
config, however, the implementation of all features should enable multi-tenancy 
by default.

Furthermore, all implementation layer code must be compatible with all modes 
unless specifically enabled only for a particular mode and documented clearly.  
Introduction of additional presentation layer fields for mode-specific options 
should be avoided to maintain the simplest possible user and API interface.

Versioning
----------

To integrate in the most flexible manner with other systems we have to implement
versioning in a flexible manner.  The version number of the template needs to 
convey three pieces of information:

.. list-table::
	:widths: 20 80
	:header-rows: 0
	:stub-columns: 1

	* - Implementation Major Version
	  - The major functionality and modes implemented by the template
	* - Implementation Minor Version
	  - The minor revision of the template.  Allows hotfixes, field-level option
	    additions and custom extension changes without impacting northbound 
	    systems
	* - Presentation Version
	  - The version of the presentation layer data model that is exposed via a 
	    northbound API

Additionally we have to also create a unique object name for the template that 
is used within BIG-IP and iWorkflow while maintaining support for previous 
versions of the template.

Assuming the following:  

 + impl_major = **0.1**
 + impl_minor = **002**

We substitute into this format:  

- Template Version: ``v<impl_major>.<impl_minor>``
- BIG-IP/IQ Template Name: ``appsvcs_integration_v<impl_major>.<impl_minor>``

Resulting in:  

- Template Version: **v0.1.002** 
- BIG-IP/IQ Template Name: **appsvcs_integration_v0.1.002**

While this scheme is somewhat complex, we have little choice in the matter, 
because most northbound integrations require that we maintain a consistent copy 
of the template for each service deployment instance throughout the entire 
automation/orchestration stack.  This versioning system allows use to maintain 
full compatibility for existing service deployment, while still providing a 
mechanism to deploy new/hotfix versions of the template without service 
impacting outages at the data plane layer for existing service deployments.
